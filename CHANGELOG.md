## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

The bring-up release. The kernel skeleton, the plugin C ABI, and the
canonical security crypto are in place. Real transports and the
security pipeline that drives the handshake land in v0.2.0; see
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

### Added

- **Kernel** — connection registry (16-shard, three indexes by id/uri/pk),
  handler / transport / security / extension registries, identity layer
  (Ed25519 keypair, two-key HKDF address derivation, attestation,
  NodeIdentity), plugin manager (`dlopen` + size-prefix vtable evolution
  + Kahn topo-sort service resolver), typed signal channel, JSON config
  loader with schema validation.
- **SDK** — C ABI plugin boundary (`gn_message_t`, `gn_endpoint_t`,
  `host_api_t`, vtable types for handler / transport / security /
  protocol), C++ convenience wrappers, ABI evolution rules
  (`abi-evolution.md`).
- **Crypto** — full Noise XX and IK state machines on libsodium
  primitives: X25519 (`crypto_scalarmult`), ChaCha20-Poly1305 IETF AEAD,
  BLAKE2b, RFC-2104 HMAC-BLAKE2b, Noise §4.3 HKDF. CipherState,
  SymmetricState, HandshakeState (XX + IK pattern progression),
  TransportState with §4 atomic rekey.
- **Reference plugins** — null security provider (loopback /
  debug pass-through), GNET protocol v1 (mandatory mesh framing,
  statically linked into the kernel).
- **Documentation** — eleven contracts in `docs/contracts/` covering the
  ABI surface end-to-end (host-api, plugin-lifetime, registry,
  protocol-layer, gnet-protocol, transport, handler-registration,
  noise-handshake, security-trust, abi-evolution, fsm-events, clock,
  limits).
- **Tests** — 304 passing: unit (configuration, identity, crypto
  primitives, handshake state, registries, plugin manager, service
  resolver, kernel router, signal channel), integration (host_api
  chain, send loopback), scenario (round-trip, disconnect), property
  (gnet wire, gnet protocol).
- **CI/CD** — five GitHub Actions jobs on every push and PR: nix flake
  check, build + test, AddressSanitizer + UBSan, ThreadSanitizer,
  strict clang-tidy on changed files.
- **Build** — Nix flake with `nix run .#build`, `nix run .#test`,
  `nix run .#test-asan`, `nix run .#test-tsan`.

### Licensing

The kernel (`core/` and the statically-linked `plugins/protocols/gnet/`)
is **GPL-2.0 with a Linking Exception**: plugins that interface only
through the stable C ABI may carry any license — MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0,
proprietary — and link statically or dynamically. SDK (`sdk/`) is MIT.
Bundled-tree convention: templates and common transports are MIT;
original implementations with no upstream analogue are Apache 2.0.

See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the full text and rationale.
